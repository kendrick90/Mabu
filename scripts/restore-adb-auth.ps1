# restore-adb-auth.ps1
#
# Reverts the two adbd byte patches applied by liberate-mabu.ps1, so the
# tablet returns to standard Android ADB authentication: any host trying
# to connect (USB or WiFi at port 5555) must be approved via the
# "Allow ADB debugging from this computer?" dialog on the touch UI.
#
# Use this when you're done provisioning a unit and about to ship/deploy
# it onto a network you don't fully trust. Without this, anyone on the
# LAN can `adb connect <ip>:5555` and get a shell, because our patches
# disabled the auth check entirely.
#
# Pre-reqs:
#   - Device in Rockchip Loader (PID 0x320A). If currently in Android,
#     get there with `adb -s <serial> shell reboot loader`.
#   - dumps/adbd-authreq-orig.bin and dumps/adbd-authinit-orig.bin must
#     exist (they were captured during the unit-2 liberation session).
#
# What's preserved: the parameter patch (verity off + selinux
# permissive), Esper APK EOCD nukes, init.esper.rc / set-device-owner.sh
# zeros, /data state. Only the adbd auth bytes are reverted.
#
# Usage:
#   .\restore-adb-auth.ps1            # write originals
#   .\restore-adb-auth.ps1 -Reset     # also send 'rd' to reboot
#   .\restore-adb-auth.ps1 -DryRun    # show what would be done

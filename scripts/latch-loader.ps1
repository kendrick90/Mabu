# latch-loader.ps1
#
# Polls for the Rockchip Loader (VID 0x2207 PID 0x320A) during the ~10 second
# power-on window and confirms it is latched and ready for rkdeveloptool.
#
# Pre-req: WinUSB must be bound to PID 0x320A (one-time Zadig step).
#          tools/rockchip-stock/RKDevTool_Release_v2.92 -> Read Flash Info
#          latches the Loader; then Zadig -> replace driver with WinUSB.
#          On a PC that has flashed before this persists automatically.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Make sure the tablet is powered OFF.
#   2. Run this script.
#   3. Power the tablet ON -- the script catches Loader automatically.

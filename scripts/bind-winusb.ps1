# bind-winusb.ps1
#
# Helper for the Zadig step: launches Zadig and tells you exactly which
# device to pick and which driver to replace it with. Driver replacement
# is intentionally interactive — Windows treats it as a security-sensitive
# operation, and so do we.
#
# What you'll do in Zadig once it opens:
#   1. Options menu  ->  check "List All Devices".
#   2. Options menu  ->  uncheck "Ignore Hubs or Composite Parents".
#      (so the rockusb interface shows up directly).
#   3. In the dropdown, pick the device whose USB ID is "2207 0006"
#      and whose name is "H7R" (or similar).
#   4. In the right-hand "Driver" box, leave the target as "WinUSB".
#   5. Click "Replace Driver" (or "Install Driver" if no driver is bound).
#   6. Wait ~30 seconds. Windows will re-enumerate.
#
# After it finishes, the device class in Device Manager moves out of
# "Universal Serial Bus devices" and into "libusb-win32 devices" or
# "Universal Serial Bus controllers" with a WinUSB driver.
#
# To revert (if anything ever goes wrong): in Device Manager, right-click
# the device -> Uninstall device -> tick "Delete the driver software" ->
# unplug/replug. Windows will rebind the default driver.

# Mabu/Esper tablet unlock — agent handoff

Long-running project. Goal: **remove Esper Device Owner kiosk from an
RK3288 Android 8.1 tablet** so the user can repurpose it.

## Latest status (2026-05-27 session)

**Unit 2 is fully scrubbed and is now the validated "template state".** Path A
strategy locked: byte-patch only, no /system dump-and-flash needed.

What was done this session:
1. Audited unit 2's DPM state via WiFi ADB (10.0.0.147:5555) — confirmed:
   `Device managed: false`, no device admins, no user restrictions, no
   esper/shoonya/catalia packages installed.
2. Recovery partition checked — zero esper/shoonya/catalia strings. Factory
   reset does NOT redeploy Esper from recovery; the bait was all in /system.
3. Found two remaining /system Esper init artifacts via ext4 inode walk
   (`scripts/find-esper-files.py`):
   - `/system/etc/init/init.esper.rc` (inode 656, data block at abs LBA
     2,076,672) — defined `set-device-owner` service.
   - `/system/bin/set-device-owner.sh` (inode 155, data block at abs LBA
     1,691,408) — ran `dpm set-device-owner io.shoonya.shoonyadpc/...`
     after every boot.
4. Extended `scripts/liberate-mabu.ps1` to write 4 KB of zeros at each
   location, plus the existing EOCD nukes. 8 patch writes total, all
   idempotent. Validated on unit 2: both files now read as all NULs from
   ADB; `init.svc.set-device-owner` is no longer registered (was "stopped"
   before; now empty).
5. Installed Lawnchair 15 Beta 3 from IzzyOnDroid (Android 8.0+ compat,
   `apks/Lawnchair.apk`). Removed Nova and KISS. Lawnchair is the default
   launcher.
6. Discovered `adb shell reboot loader` cleanly puts the device in Loader
   without a physical power cycle. Enables fully automated Loader cycles.
7. Empirically measured Loader read wedge: in a fresh session, ~7 chunks
   of 4 MB succeed (~28 MB) before wedging on chunk 8. Wedge state
   requires a physical power cycle to recover (`rd` returns
   "creating comm object failed"). Implication: any future /system dump
   must do small batches (5×4MB = 20 MB safe margin) with `rd` and
   `adb reboot loader` between batches. `scripts/dump-system-cycled.ps1`
   has this state-machine but was not exercised this session because
   Path A doesn't need a full dump.

**Assembly-line procedure for a NEW Mabu unit (Path A):**

1. Connect via internal USB harness.
2. Catch Rockchip Loader (PID 0x320A) on power-on.
3. `.\scripts\liberate-mabu.ps1 -Reset` — applies all 8 patches
   (parameter, two adbd, three Esper APK EOCDs, init.esper.rc,
   set-device-owner.sh) and resets the device.
4. If the unit was Esper-active (kiosk visible pre-flash), also run
   `.\scripts\wipe-data-head.ps1 -SizeMB 96 -Reset` to clear stale
   kiosk policies. Skip for factory-reset units.
5. Wait for Android boot, `adb connect <tablet-ip>:5555`.
6. `adb install apks/F-Droid.apk apks/Lawnchair.apk` and
   `adb shell cmd package set-home-activity app.lawnchair/.LawnchairLauncher`.
7. Close up the unit.

This works because every Mabu we've seen has byte-identical /system (same
H7R 8.1.0 build dated Mar 2022). If a unit ever ships with a different
build, the cycled dumper falls back to dump-and-flash.

**Unit 2 final state (template reference):**
- IP: 10.0.0.147 (DHCP — set a static lease for stability)
- WiFi ADB: stable, no auth dialog, port 5555
- DPM: clean (no owner, no admins, no restrictions)
- /system Esper APKs: corrupted EOCDs (PackageManager skips)
- /system init scripts: init.esper.rc + set-device-owner.sh both
  zeroed (init parses no Esper service)
- Launcher: Lawnchair 15 Beta 3
- Other apps: F-Droid

## Previous status (2026-05-25 session 2)

**Esper kiosk neutralized.** Device now boots to normal Android home
screen (no Esper UI, no kiosk lock). What worked:

1. dm-verity disabled via parameter file patch (from session 1)
2. Located all three Esper APKs on /system/app via ext4 walking
   (espersupervisor inode 441, esperdpc inode 475, esperhelper inode 518)
3. Corrupted the EOCD signature (`PK\x05\x06` → `\x00\x00\x00\x00`) of
   each APK's zip via single-sector writes (4 bytes each, see
   `scripts/find-eocd.py` / dumps/*-apk-eocd-patched.bin). PackageManager
   skips these on next scan.
4. Wiped userdata partition head (first 256 MB) via Loader — forced vold
   to reformat /data. Original 16 MB snapshot preserved at
   dumps/userdata-original-head.bin in case revert needed.
5. After reset, USB enumerated as PID 0x0011 (standard Rockchip MTP+ADB,
   was 0x0006 under Esper). Home screen visible, no kiosk.

**Resolved:** ADB shell now works unconditionally. Root cause was NOT
ro.adb.secure — adbd on this Rockchip 8.1 build has the `auth_required`
global hardcoded to `1` in its .data section (Rockchip's adbd seems to
ignore `ro.adb.secure`). One-byte patch at file_off 0xD311C of
/system/bin/adbd flips it to `0`. We also patched adbd_auth_init to
return immediately (defense in depth). Loader-side sectors written:

  abs LBA 1,696,240 (one byte at offset 284 in sector: 0x01 -> 0x00)
  abs LBA 1,694,778 (two bytes at offset 56-57: F0 B5 -> 70 47 / BX LR)

`adb devices` returns `device` immediately on next boot — no dialog,
no host-key approval needed.

**Settings.apk crash explained:** narrowed to Developer Options sub-page
only. `DevelopmentSettings.onResume() -> SystemProperties.set(...)` fails
because SELinux denies system_app write to `logpersistd_logging_prop`.
Settings doesn't handle the failure -> uncaught RuntimeException.

We tried patching `/system/etc/selinux/plat_property_contexts` to change
the type to `log_prop` (sectors at abs LBA 2076322 and 2076324). It had
no effect because **Android 8.1 uses the precompiled binary policy at
`/vendor/etc/selinux/precompiled_sepolicy`** at runtime, not the text
file. The text file is just one of several inputs compiled into the
binary at build time. Patches reverted; left as a finding for future
attempts. To actually fix this you'd need to either:
  - Patch the precompiled binary (CIL/SEPolicy blob — fragile)
  - Patch Settings.apk's classes.dex to skip setLogpersistOff
  - Install a third-party Activity Launcher app to bypass the crashing
    sub-page

Practical answer: avoid the Dev Options sub-page on the tablet UI; use
ADB shell for everything Dev Options would do (logcat config, animation
scale, USB tethering, etc.).

**WiFi ADB is on.** `service.adb.tcp.port=5555` is in /vendor/build.prop
and adbd's auth_required is 0 (our patch), so on every boot you can
`adb connect <tablet-ip>:5555` from any host on the LAN without USB
and without an approval dialog. The tablet IP is DHCP — set a static
lease for it on your router if you want a stable address.

## Two distinct Mabu-unit states we've seen

There are two starting states for a Mabu unit, and they need slightly
different treatment:

**A) Active Esper-managed (kiosk visible, Esper backend tried to run):**
  - /data/system/device_policies.xml contains both the Device Owner ref
    AND kiosk policies (lock task, app whitelist, etc.)
  - Even with Esper APKs corrupted, DPM tries to enforce those policies
  - To get a usable tablet you MUST wipe /data (we did 256-320 MB of
    Loader-side zeroing on the first unit). Dev Options may regress
    due to vold's incomplete reformat.

**B) Factory-reset Esper-managed (no kiosk shown, but DO still set):**
  - /data is clean: kiosk policies wiped by factory reset
  - The Device Owner reference persists across factory reset (FRP-like)
    but with no policies attached, it doesn't enforce anything
  - Esper APK corruption + adbd patches alone is enough — NO /data wipe
  - Dev Options works on-device UI (because /data is in pristine
    factory-reset state)
  - USB ADB still wedges (Esper's stale DPM service keeps trying to
    reach the dead admin) -- USE WIFI ADB instead

For both states, the v2 liberate-mabu.ps1 (parameter + adbd patches)
gives you ADB. WiFi ADB is the most reliable transport on either, since
TCP isn't subject to whatever USB-layer game the lingering Esper code
plays. State (B) is essentially done once liberate-mabu has run plus
Esper APK EOCDs are nuked.

## Open problem: full-device backup procedure

The session 3 priority became "back up every Mabu before doing anything
destructive." We did NOT solve this. State of the question:

**Symptoms observed:**
- cpebit's rkdeveloptool `rl` works for chunks up to ~4 MB. Larger
  chunks (8/16/32/64 MB single reads) fail outright -- not just slow,
  the device returns "Read LBA failed" or hangs.
- Cumulative chunk reads in one Loader session seem to wedge somewhere
  past 30-100 MB (varied across attempts). Once wedged, even small
  reads return "creating comm object failed" until power-cycle.
- We don't know if the wedge is a Loader-side state-leak (the firmware
  on Rockchip can't handle many CBWs in one session) or a cpebit-tool
  bug (libusb context per `rl` invocation -> handle accumulation in
  the device endpoint).
- pyusb-based attempt (scripts/dump-all.py) hits libusb "Pipe error"
  on the first CBW write -- the OUT endpoint stalls. Tried matching
  byte-for-byte against the supposedly-working rockusb.py and still
  stalls. Some Windows + WinUSB-bound + Rockchip-FF/06/05 interaction
  we haven't characterized.

**Things we tried that DON'T work:**
- Larger rkdeveloptool chunk sizes (8 MB and up: immediate failure)
- pyusb persistent-handle rockusb client (pipe error on CBW)
- ADB shell `dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk1 ...` (block devices are root-
  only on user build; shell has zero capabilities; SELinux enforcing;
  no `adb root` since not userdebug)
- Booting to recovery via misc partition (Rockchip ignores standard
  Android BCB format -- documented earlier in this file)

**Things to try next:**

1. **rkdeveloptool 4 MB chunks with power-cycle between groups.** Do
   ~6 chunks (24 MB), power-cycle the device to reset Loader state,
   resume from the next chunk. Tedious but lets us dump the full
   12 GB of eMMC across N power-cycles. dump-range.ps1 already has
   the chunk timeout machinery; just need a wrapper that pauses and
   asks the user to power-cycle.

2. **Bypass cpebit's `rl` by calling libusb directly via dump-all.py,
   but figure out why CBW writes stall.** The interface descriptor
   shows FF/06/05 (not the more standard FF/FF/00 of recovery). The
   stall might be from missing a clear-feature/halt sequence on the
   bulk OUT endpoint after Zadig's WinUSB binding. Try
   `usb.util.dispose_resources()` + reset + claim_interface again
   before the first CBW. Also try sending a SCSI INQUIRY or
   TestUnitReady (opcode 0x00) first as a "wake up" CBW.

3. **Build cpebit's rkdeveloptool from upstream source on Windows**
   with bigger chunk buffers and proper handle reuse. Source:
   github.com/rockchip-linux/rkdeveloptool.

4. **Sidestep the backup question for Mabu-software extraction.**
   On a fresh Mabu, instead of forensic raw dump, do a "privileged
   helper" approach: write a small APK to /system/priv-app/ via
   Loader; it runs in system_app context which can read /data/data/
   for any app. From ADB shell, signal that helper (broadcast intent)
   to copy /data/data/com.catalia.* to /sdcard, then `adb pull`. This
   handles Mabu data even though /data is FBE-encrypted -- Android
   already decrypted DE storage at boot, the helper just walks the
   filesystem.

scripts/dump-all.py is a starting point for #2. Both protocol fix
attempts (cmd_len, params layout, single-bulk-read) are in there.
rockusb.py is updated to accept PID 0x320A and any vendor-class
interface (FF/06/05 OR FF/FF/00). Power cycle the tablet to a fresh
Loader before each attempt.

## Assembly-line strategy (next phase)

The byte-patching v3 procedure works but is per-unit and unreliable
(broke Dev Options on unit 1, narrowly succeeded on units 2 and the
current third unit). For going scale, we shift to a "clean firmware
flash" model:

**Reference units we have:**
- **Unit 1** (serial 2022010502079): liberated but Dev Options crashes.
  Lost Mabu IP to wipe. Useful as the first flash-validation target
  (already broken; can't make it worse).
- **Unit 2** (serial 2022010500480, IP 10.0.0.147): fully liberated +
  Nova Launcher + F-Droid + Dev Options works + DPM clean + WiFi ADB
  stable. **This is the template donor.**
- **Unit 3** (serial 2022010501476, IP 10.0.0.252): fresh Esper-active
  Mabu, but we've already extracted its Mabu IP into
  mabu-archive/unit-2022010501476/ (56 MB: 7 APKs + sdcard +
  dumpsys/getprop). Leave it Esper-active for now as a reference
  Esper-managed state. Will eventually be a flash-validation target.

**Build pipeline (tasks #13-#16):**

1. **Dump unit 2's clean state** as the template:
   - /system (~2 GB) -- still need to solve Loader read wedge OR
     `adb pull /system/` recursively + rebuild as ext4 on host using
     mkfs.ext4 / make_ext4fs (preserves files; SELinux contexts may
     need separate fixup via fs_config + selinux contexts file).
   - /vendor (256 MB), should be identical across units but capture
     anyway.
   - parameter.img (already have).
   - manifest of /data/app to know which APKs to side-install on
     first boot (Nova, F-Droid).
   - Output: a flashable `clean-system.img` + companion `clean-data-
     starter.tar` for post-boot install.

2. **Build `flash-clean-firmware.ps1`**:
   - Catches Loader.
   - Writes parameter-patched.img to LBA 0.
   - Writes clean-system.img to LBA 0x18A000 (2 GB write, will need
     chunking; writes haven't shown the cumulative-wedge that reads
     have, so single-shot bulk write may work).
   - Wipes /data head 96 MB so vold reformats fresh.
   - Sends `rd`.
   - Tablet boots into the donor state automatically. Factory reset
     stays in the donor state (no Esper anywhere in /system to
     re-deploy, no DO in /data).

3. **Validate** on unit 1 first (already broken, low risk), then on
   unit 3 (fresh Mabu, real-world validation).

4. **Assembly-line procedure for new Mabus**:
   - Plug in via harness.
   - Run `flash-clean-firmware.ps1` -- one command, one harness cycle.
   - Close up.

   No Mabu IP extraction needed on future units -- the software is
   byte-identical to what we already captured from unit 3 (APKs +
   animation CSVs in APK assets, native libs including libsercomm,
   Nuance voice stack).

   **Per-unit motor calibration:** lives in
   /data/data/com.catalia.factorymode/ (owner-only, shell can't read)
   AND gets wiped on flash. Instead of engineering a privileged-helper
   APK to extract it before flashing, the cleaner answer is to BUNDLE
   com.catalia.factorymode.apk (already in mabu-archive) in the clean
   firmware. On a flashed unit, the user opens factory mode and runs
   its built-in calibration wizard, which rederives the motor zeros and
   writes them to the freshly-formatted /data/data/com.catalia.factorymode/.
   The robot's hardware doesn't care whether the calibration values
   were extracted or freshly re-measured -- it just needs SOME current
   values.

**App-store choice:** install Aurora Store via F-Droid on the
template-donor (unit 2) before dumping. Aurora provides Play-Store-
catalog access without needing Google Play Services. Lighter than
OpenGApps; sufficient for repurposed-tablet use cases.

## Operational reality

Deployed Mabu tablets have **NO external USB port and NO buttons** —
they're embedded in the robot body. USB access requires a special
internal-header harness that:
  - We have only ONE of
  - Blocks the rest of the robot from operating while connected
  - Is therefore a one-shot-per-unit liberation opportunity

This reframes the goal: the deliverable is a tablet with **persistent
wireless ADB** (`service.adb.tcp.port=5555` already in vendor build.prop,
just need an adbd that doesn't require auth + WiFi credentials on
/data). Once that's live we close the device up and never need the
harness again on that unit.

The 1-step-patcher we want to build is: harness-on, run one command,
harness-off, done. See tasks #9-#12.

## V3 Liberation procedure (current best-practice, validated)

Wipe size matters. Two passes on first unit (256 + 320 MB) left Dev
Options crashing. The second unit (96 MB before Loader wedged) ended up
with a fully working Dev Options + cleared Device Owner. So aim small.

Full procedure for a NEXT Mabu unit (do these steps in order):

1. **Catch Loader** (PID 0x320A on power-on, hold the recovery button
   if the boot is too fast). USB connected.

2. **Apply core patches:**
     .\scripts\liberate-mabu.ps1
   This writes the parameter file (verity off + selinux permissive) and
   the two adbd patches (auth_required = 0 and adbd_auth_init -> BX LR).

3. **BACK UP MABU SOFTWARE if this is an unwiped (Esper-active) unit.**
   This is the hardest step. Esper actively wedges USB ADB within ~5
   seconds of boot, so you have a narrow window. Three strategies, in
   ascending complexity, try in order:

   3a. **Race against the wedge.** After 'rkdeveloptool rd', the device
       boots in ~30s. As soon as 'adb devices' shows 'device', fire one
       compound command:

         adb -s <serial> shell "
           am force-stop io.shoonya.shoonyadpc;
           am force-stop io.shoonya.shoonyahelper;
           am force-stop io.shoonya.shoonyasupervisor;
           pm disable-user --user 0 io.shoonya.shoonyadpc;
           pm disable-user --user 0 io.shoonya.shoonyahelper;
           pm disable-user --user 0 io.shoonya.shoonyasupervisor;
           tar cf /sdcard/mabu.tar /data/data/com.catalia.* /data/app/com.catalia.* 2>/dev/null;
           ls -la /sdcard/mabu.tar
         "
         adb -s <serial> pull /sdcard/mabu.tar ./mabu-<serial>.tar

       The pm disable-user calls might fail if Esper has anti-disable
       restrictions, but force-stop usually wins long enough for the
       tar. If USB drops mid-pull, retry from the next strategy.

   3b. **WiFi ADB.** Esper-managed Mabus had to be provisioned via
       network, so WiFi credentials are persisted in /data and auto-
       connect at boot. Find the tablet's IP (router DHCP table, or
       'nmap -p 5555 192.168.x.0/24'), then:
         adb connect <ip>:5555
       service.adb.tcp.port=5555 is set in /vendor/build.prop and our
       adbd-patched binary listens on 5555 from boot. WiFi transport
       isn't subject to Esper's USB shenanigans (proven on second unit).

   3c. **Selective Esper neutralization first.** Before extracting Mabu,
       go back to Loader and corrupt JUST esperhelper.apk EOCD (LBA
       2063565). Theory: 'helper' is the USB sentry. With it dead and
       esperdpc + espersupervisor still alive, the kiosk UI keeps Mabu
       accessible but USB ADB stays stable. UNTESTED -- the next fresh
       Mabu is the validation opportunity.

   If 'pm list packages | grep -i catalia' returns empty: the unit
   was already factory-reset, Mabu app is gone, skip this step
   entirely.

4. **Catch Loader again** (power-cycle and re-catch).

5. **Corrupt Esper APK EOCDs** (kills Esper's three packages):
     wl 1851238 dumps/espersupervisor-apk-eocd-patched.bin
     wl 1981802 dumps/esperdpc-apk-eocd-patched.bin
     wl 2063565 dumps/esperhelper-apk-eocd-patched.bin

6. **Wipe ~96 MB of /data** (clears Device Owner reference, triggers
   fresh vold reformat without breaking Dev Options):
     .\scripts\wipe-data-head.ps1 -SizeMB 96 -Reset

7. **Wait for boot.** First boot reformats /data, takes ~30-60s longer
   than usual. 'adb devices' should show 'device' immediately. USB
   transport now stable (Esper DPM ghost gone).

8. **Install a launcher** (none on stock /system):
     adb install apks/F-Droid.apk
     adb install apks/KISS.apk
     adb shell cmd package set-home-activity fr.neamar.kiss/.MainActivity
     adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.HOME
   From the tablet UI you can now install anything else (browser, etc)
   via F-Droid.

## Original V2 procedure (for reference)

Critical insight: **don't wipe /data, don't corrupt Esper APKs until
AFTER you have the Mabu software backed up.** The original procedure
(corrupt APKs + wipe /data) destroyed the Mabu app on this unit. For
future units:

1. Catch Rockchip Loader (PID 0x320A) on boot.
2. Run `scripts/liberate-mabu.ps1 -Reset`. This applies only the
   parameter patch + the two adbd patches.
3. Wait for Android to boot. `adb devices` shows `device` instantly.
4. Backup Mabu software:
     adb shell tar cf /sdcard/mabu-backup.tar /data/data/com.catalia.* \
       /data/app/com.catalia.* /data/misc/sounds 2>/dev/null
     adb pull /sdcard/mabu-backup.tar ./mabu-<serial>-backup.tar
5. (Optional) Now do the destructive de-Esper steps on this unit:
   - Corrupt Esper APK EOCDs (use dumps/*-apk-eocd-patched.bin)
   - Wipe /data head 256 MB (use dumps/zeros-16mb.bin x16)
   - Reset; device boots to vanilla Android with no kiosk.

**Useful infrastructure built this session:**
- `scripts/dump-range.ps1` — range-aware partition dump with per-chunk
  timeout (kills wedged Loader sessions in 45s instead of hanging)
- `scripts/find-prop-default.py` — walks ext4 using inode tables
  (flex_bg packs all 16 inode tables in first ~34 MB of /system; we have
  them all in system.img) to locate any /system/etc/* file
- `scripts/find-esper.py` — lists /system/app and /system/priv-app
- `scripts/patch-prop-sector.py` — built ro.adb.secure=0 sector write
  (took effect on disk; doesn't help at runtime because adbd reads
  ro.adb.secure once at startup and the prop is being set to 1 earlier
  by some other source)

## Original session notes follow

We've made significant progress; one final step is blocked.

---

## What we've established (don't re-discover)

### Hardware

- **Device**: Mabu robot tablet (Catalia Health, defunct ~2020-2022).
  Board ID `HRA7_RK3288W_V1.2_2021.10.15`.
- **SoC**: Rockchip **RK3288** (Cortex-A17 quad, confirmed via 320A PID
  and chip-info readback).
- **eMMC**: Samsung 16 GB BGA on a Foresee-branded package
  (`NCEMAD9D-16G`, 14800 MB user area, 30,310,400 sectors of 512 B,
  block 512 KB, page 2 KB).
- **OS**: Android 8.1.0, security patch level 2018-09-05, Esper-managed
  Device Owner mode (kiosk shell, hidden system dialogs, dead MDM
  tenant).
- **Wiring**: USB OTG broken out via a 30-pin header on the main PCB.
  D+/D- polarity was the wiring gotcha to remember (swap fixes
  "device descriptor request failed").

### Software tooling, in place at `tools/`

- `tools/rkdeveloptool/rkdeveloptool.exe` — cpebit's Windows build
  (libusb-based; works only when device is bound to WinUSB)
- `tools/rockchip-stock/DriverAssitant_v5.0/` — official Rockchip
  USB driver bundle (installs `rockusb.sys`)
- `tools/rockchip-stock/RKDevTool_Release_v2.92/` — Rockchip GUI
  (works with rockusb.sys binding, doesn't with WinUSB)
- `tools/google-usb-driver/` — patched Google ADB driver for VID 2207
- `tools/testkey/` — AOSP testkey.x509.pem + testkey.pk8 (not used in
  the current path; was for failed sideload sig attempt)
- Python 3.13 with `cryptography`, `pyusb`, `libusb-package`, `zeroconf`
- adb / fastboot in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Google.PlatformTools_*`
- Zadig (winget id `akeo.ie.Zadig`)

### Critical technical findings

**1. Rockchip Loader window:** during normal boot, u-boot exposes
PID 0x320A on USB for ~10 seconds. Any rockusb command latches it
into Loader mode indefinitely.

**2. Driver chain:** WinUSB binding is needed for `rkdeveloptool` CLI
control. The Rockchip-bundled `rockusb.sys` (installed by
DriverInstall.exe in DriverAssistant) gives RKDevTool GUI access only.
We Zadig-bound WinUSB to PID 320A; that path is current.

**3. Partition layout** (from parameter file at sector 0):

| Partition  | Start LBA  | Size LBA   | Size     |
|------------|-----------:|-----------:|---------:|
| parameter  | 0x00000000 | 16         | 8 KB     |
| uboot      | 0x00002000 | 0x00002000 | 4 MB     |
| trust      | 0x00004000 | 0x00002000 | 4 MB     |

**4. Boot.img patches DON'T WORK.** Tested two variants:
  - Re-patched with new AOSP-style SHA-1 in id field → tablet boots
    only to recovery
  - Re-patched with original id field preserved byte-for-byte → also
    boots only to recovery
  Conclusion: either Rockchip's u-boot does verification beyond the
  boot.img header id field that we haven't found, OR our cpio rewrite
  is subtly corrupt (changing /default.prop from symlink to regular
  file). Either way, boot.img path is currently blocked.

**5. PARAMETER FILE PATCH WORKS!** ⭐ Modified the cmdline in the
parameter file at sector 0 to add `androidboot.veritymode=disabled`
and `androidboot.selinux=permissive`, recomputed the **Rockchip
custom CRC32** (polynomial **`0x04C10DB7`**, init=0, no reflection,
no final xor — one bit different from IEEE 802.3), wrote back via
`rkdeveloptool wl 0 parameter-patched.img`, sent reset, and the tablet
**booted normally to main Android** with both flags active.
  - Patched parameter file is at `dumps/parameter-patched.img`
  - Patcher: `scripts/patch-parameter.py`
  - **dm-verity is now disabled on this device.** We can modify
    `/system` content and the kernel will not refuse to mount it.

**6. ADB current state** (post-parameter-patch): tablet boots to main
Android, enumerates as `VID 2207 PID 0006 H7R 2022010502079`. adb
shows the device as `offline` (wedged handshake we've seen
throughout). The Esper kiosk still suppresses the auth dialog.

## Current blocker: dumping /system is unreliable

Plan was: dump system.img (2 GB at sector 0x18A000) → byte-replace
`ro.adb.secure=1` → `0` and similar → write back → reboot → unauth ADB
works because verity is off.

**The Loader gets wedged during long reads.** We've observed:
- ~32 MB single-shot reads → fail at 2%
- 4 MB chunked reads with `catch-loader-and-dump.ps1` → worked for
  boot (32 MB), recovery (64 MB), misc (4 MB)
- But the system dump (2 GB) hung at **35,717,120 bytes (1.7%)** —
  somewhere between chunks 8 and 9. rkdeveloptool process stuck
  holding the USB device.

**Hypothesis:** u-boot Loader has either a session byte-limit or a
session time-limit. Once exceeded, it stops responding. To recover,
we power-cycle the tablet (force off via PWRON >7s, then power back
on) and re-catch the Loader window.

## Files / scripts on disk

- `scripts/patch-bootimg.py` — boot.img unpack/repack (currently
  blocked, see above; supports `--keep-id`)
- `scripts/patch-parameter.py` — parameter file unpack/repack with
  correct Rockchip CRC32 (**works**)
- `scripts/patch-system-props.py` — binary search-and-replace for
  prop values in a system.img dump (ready to use once we have a
  full dump)
- `scripts/catch-loader-and-dump.ps1` — polls for Loader, locks in,
  does chunked partition dumps
- `scripts/write-patched-boot.ps1` — abandoned (boot.img path dead)
- `scripts/restore-boot.ps1` — emergency restore if a patch bricks
  boot (writes back original boot.img + clears misc)
- `scripts/roundtrip-test.py` — diagnostic for cpio/boot.img
  round-trip (revealed the SHA-1 mismatch)
- `scripts/find-hash-formula.py` — checked 14 SHA-1 variants against
  boot.img id field, none matched
- `scripts/rockusb.py` / `scripts/rockusb_winusb.py` — pure-Python
  rockusb clients (mostly dead-end work; recovery's MI_01 is not
  rockusb)
- `dumps/` — current working dumps (boot.img, recovery.img, misc.img,
  parameter.img, parameter-patched.img, partial system.img at 35 MB)
- `dumps-tablet-reset/` — backup dumps from the OTHER reset tablet
  (identical boot.img, kept just in case)

## Strategic options for next agent

In rough order of effort:

### Option A (smartest) — only dump what we need, not all 2 GB

The text we need to modify is in `/system/build.prop` and
`/system/etc/prop.default` — total a few KB. Rather than dumping the
whole 2 GB partition:

1. Dump the first ~256 MB of system in 4 MB chunks. Build.prop and
   prop.default are almost certainly in the first 100 MB of an ext4
   filesystem (small files, allocated early).
2. Search the partial dump for `ro.adb.secure=1` and friends.
3. Note their **exact byte offsets within the partition**.
4. Issue per-offset writes: write a few bytes back via
   `rkdeveloptool wl <lba> <small-file>` where the small file is a
   block that fills sectors containing the prop strings with the
   modified value.

This avoids the 2 GB dump problem entirely. **Strongly recommended.**

### Option B — chunk dump but stop and restart Loader sessions

Modify `catch-loader-and-dump.ps1` to:
- Dump 5–10 chunks (20–40 MB)
- Then issue `rkdeveloptool rd` (resets device to boot)
- Wait for Loader window again
- Resume from the next chunk

Tedious but each session stays under the wedge threshold. The user
would have to power-cycle between sessions.

### Option C — investigate kernel partition

There's a `kernel` partition at sector 0x10000, 32 MB, that we never
dumped. Possibility: u-boot loads the actual booting kernel/ramdisk
from there, not from `boot`. That would explain why our boot.img
patches had no effect. **Worth a 32 MB dump just to know.**

### Option D — userdata adbkey injection

With dm-verity disabled, we can modify /system. But ANOTHER avenue:
add the host's `~/.android/adbkey.pub` to `/data/misc/adb/adb_keys`.
This bypasses the auth dialog because the host's key is then "already
trusted". Requires:
- Checking whether userdata uses FBE (File-Based Encryption). If yes,
  we can't write valid encrypted blocks without the device's key.
  Check by reading the ext4 superblock at sector 0x692400 + 2 (i.e.
  superblock is at byte 1024 of the partition) and looking for the
  encrypt feature flag.
- If no FBE: find the existing `/data/misc/adb/adb_keys` file's
  inode, append our key, write back. Tricky if it doesn't exist
  yet (have to create new inode + extent + dir entry).

## Steps to resume

1. **Kill any lingering rkdeveloptool/powershell processes** holding
   the USB device.
2. **User power-cycles the tablet** (force off, then on). USB OTG
   stays plugged.
3. Run `scripts/catch-loader-and-dump.ps1 -Names <partition>` to
   catch Loader and dump.
4. For full /system: pursue Option A (search the first ~256 MB for
   prop strings, then targeted byte writes).

## Things known to be working

- ✅ rkdeveloptool CLI talks to Loader (PID 320A) via WinUSB binding
- ✅ Parameter file patching with custom Rockchip CRC32
- ✅ Reads of up to ~64 MB partitions complete reliably
- ✅ dm-verity is disabled on the live device (parameter patch took)

## Things known to be broken

- ❌ Boot.img repacking — bootloader rejects our images even with
  original id preserved
- ❌ Long single rockusb sessions (>30s or >100 MB ish) — Loader
  wedges, requires power-cycle

## User preferences captured

- Wants visible terminal windows for heavy ops (so they can see what's
  happening). For state checks, the PowerShell tool's output is fine.
- ASCII-only in `.ps1` files (Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads BOM-less
  UTF-8 as Windows-1252 and chokes on em-dashes etc. We have a saved
  memory at `~/.claude/projects/.../feedback_powershell_ascii.md`).
- Stop suggesting password guesses on lockout-protected systems —
  we have a saved memory on this from the Esper admin password
  incident.
